			 Parsing Information
				 for
                      Robinson-like parsing tags
                Adapted from Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen's
                    Description for Tischendorf 8th


Introduction
============

This document describes the parsing used in all Robinson-Pierpont
texts, with a few extensions.  The extensions are detailed
below. Since this morphological analysis is a derivative of
Dr. Robinson's Westcott-Hort analysis, it follows the same schema.

The parts of speech are listed below.

Then, for each group of "similar" parts of speech, a section is given
which shows what pattern the group follows.  For example, the
noun-like parts of speech have this pattern:

  pos case number gender [suffix]

here "pos" means "part of speech", and can be either "N-" (for noun),
"A-" (for adjective), or "T-" (for article).

After the part of speech, three fields always appear, namely "case",
"number", and "gender".  Then, an optional "suffix" may be present.
The fact that "[suffix]" is in [square brackets] shows that it is
optional.

In order to see what options are available for a given category, find
the corresponding section below which describes the category, such as
"Gender", "Number", etc.

Not all combinations are used, nor are all possible category-members
used.


Extensions
==========

The sole extension made, which is not part of Dr. Robinson's schema,
is to add a new part of speech:

PUNCT - punctuation

Parts of speech with Case, Number, Gender
=========================================

  N- : noun
  A- : adjective
  T- : article

Pattern:

  pos case number gender [suffix]


Verbs
=====

  V- : verb

Patterns:

  V- tense voice I person number [verb-extra]
  V- tense voice S person number [verb-extra]
  V- tense voice O person number [verb-extra]
  V- tense voice M person number [verb-extra]
  V- tense voice N 
  V- tense voice P case number gender [verb-extra]
  V- tense voice R case number gender [verb-extra]


Pronominal parts of speech
==========================
  P- : personal pronoun
  R- : relative pronoun
  C- : reciprocal pronoun
  D- : demonstrative pronoun
  K- : correlative pronoun
  I- : interrogative pronoun
  X- : indefinite pronoun
  Q- : correlative or interrogative pronoun
  F- : reflexive pronoun
  S- : possessive pronoun

Pattern:

  pos [person] case number [gender] [suffix]

For possessive pronouns (S-), the pattern is:

  S- person-of-possessor number-of-possessor case-of-possessed number-of-possessed gender-of-possessed

For example, SOU/S is S-2SAPM, because the number of the possessor is
second person singular, whereas the possessed is accusative plural
masculine.
